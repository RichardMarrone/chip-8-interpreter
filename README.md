# Chip 8 Virtual Machine

A CHIP-8 virtual machine written in python. I created this as an exercise to learn more about creating virtual machines. All test cases are from the resources below. You can also use ```generate_bytecode.py``` to manually write bytes to a file in big endian order. All features currently work with the exception of sound.
